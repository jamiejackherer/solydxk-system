	<h1>SolydXK System Settings: Device Driver Help</h1>
	<div class="main">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The Device Driver is a tool to help users installing third-party hardware drivers. Currently Nvidia, AMD/ATI and Broadcom drivers can be installed and allows to install the PAE kernel for multi-core 32-bit systems. The Device Driver will only list those devices that are supported. It will not list any other devices then mentioned above.</p>

		<h2>Important</h2>
		<p>The Device Driver can only install drivers which are available in the repositories. Make sure you have an internet connection if you want to install the drivers.</p>

		<h2>Commands</h2>
		<p>If you prefer to install the drivers by terminal, you can use the following commands:</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h3># ddm -i amd</h3>
		<p>This will install the drivers for your AMD/ATI graphical card. AMD/ATI cards from version HD 5000 and up are supported by the drivers. Versions between 1000 and 5000 will use the Radeon drivers. Use "ddm -p amd" to remove the drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i nvidia</h3>
		<p>This will select the right drivers for your Nvidia graphical card. It will select the Bumblebee drivers in case you have a hybrid card (both Nvidia and Intel). Use "ddm -p nvidia" to remove the drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i open</h3>
		<p>You can use this command if you want to revert back to the open Nouveau drivers. It will remove any proprietary drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i broadcom</h3>
		<p>This command will install the right driver for your wireless Broadcom adapter. Use "ddm -p broadcom" to remove the drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i pae</h3>
		<p>This will install the PAE kernel on multi-processor systems running a 32-bit OS. Use "ddm -p pae" to remove the PAE kernel from your system. Note that you cannot remove the kernel when you are currently booted into that kernel.</p>
